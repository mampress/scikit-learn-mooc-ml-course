# Basics of Machine Learning - Course Repository

This repository contains my work and exercises for the **Basics of Machine Learning** course. The course covers the foundational concepts of machine learning, and is composed of **9 main modules**. Each module introduces important machine learning algorithms, methods, and techniques that are essential for understanding and applying machine learning.

## Course Overview

The course is structured into the following 8 modules:

1. **The predictive modeling pipeline**
2. **Selecting the best model**
3. **Hyperparameter tuning**
4. **Linear models**
5. **Decision tree models**
6. **Ensemble of models**
7. **Evaluating model performance**
8. **Feature selection**
9. **Interpretation**
